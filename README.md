# palworld-breeder-path

I'm just messing around trying to improve upon this website.

What I'd like to see:
- Ability to make a pal mandatory in the tree
- Ability to consider passive traits and IV that are desired to be passed down
- Ability to consider Male/Female availability

I have no idea what I'm doing.
